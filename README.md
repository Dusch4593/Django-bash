# Django-bash
This is a bash script for setting up django on unix systems, specifically Ubuntu OS. For Windows, change the virtual environment from `/venv/bin/activate` to `venv/scripts/activate`

There are two bash scripts,`djangobash.sh` is an older version. `s.sh` is a newer version. Prefarably use a shortlink and curl to call the file. :)

Bityly shortlink is https://bit.ly/3zctaUI 
Run `curl -L https://bit.ly/3zctaUI > s.sh` then `source s.sh`
